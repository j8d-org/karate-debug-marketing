        <h1>Karate Debug - End User License Agreement</h1>
        <p class="copyright">© 2026 Karate Debug. All Rights Reserved.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE.
        </div>

        <p>By installing, copying, or otherwise using this software ("Software"), you agree to be bound by the terms of this End User License Agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree to these terms, do not install or use the Software.</p>

        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Software"</strong> means the Karate Debug plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and/or Visual Studio Code, including any updates, patches, or documentation provided by Licensor.</li>
            <li><strong>"Licensor"</strong> means Ryan Stutzman.</li>
            <li><strong>"Authorized User"</strong> means an individual person who is authorized to use the Software under a valid license.</li>
            <li><strong>"Activation"</strong> means installing and activating the Software on a single device (computer or IDE instance).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Grant of License</h2>
        <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Software for your personal or internal business purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>License Scope:</strong> Each paid license permits one (1) Authorized User to activate the Software on up to five (5) devices. Each device counts as one activation, regardless of whether the Software is installed for IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or both. The license is personal to the Authorized User and may not be shared with other individuals. Contractors and consultants working on your behalf may use the Software only if they are the named Authorized User or if a separate license is obtained for them.</p>

        <h2>3. Trial Period</h2>
        <p>The Software includes a free trial period of thirty (30) days from the date of first installation ("Trial Period"). During the Trial Period, you may use all features of the Software at no cost. After the Trial Period expires, continued use of the Software requires a valid paid subscription. Reinstalling or resetting the Software does not extend or restart the Trial Period. Upon expiration, the Software will cease to function until a valid license is activated.</p>

        <h2>4. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You may NOT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Software;</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of the Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law;</li>
            <li>Rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer the Software or any rights therein to any third party;</li>
            <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the Software;</li>
            <li>Use the Software to develop a competing product or service;</li>
            <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any licensing, trial, or copy protection mechanisms in the Software;</li>
            <li>Share license keys or activation credentials with unauthorized users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Software and all copies thereof are proprietary to Licensor and title thereto remains exclusively with Licensor. All rights in the Software not specifically granted in this Agreement are reserved to Licensor. The Software is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Software</h2>
        <p>The Software may include or depend on third-party libraries and open-source components, which are subject to their own license terms. A list of such components and their licenses is available upon request. Your use of such components is governed by their respective licenses.</p>

        <h2>7. Updates and Support</h2>
        <p>Licensor may, at its sole discretion, provide updates, patches, or new versions of the Software. Licensor is under no obligation to provide support, maintenance, updates, or future versions. Licensor reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Software (or any part thereof) at any time without liability.</p>

        <h2>8. Privacy and Data</h2>
        <p>The Software operates primarily on your local machine. The Software does not collect, transmit, or store your source code, test data, or API credentials. The Software may transmit limited data for license validation purposes only (such as a license key and machine identifier). No telemetry or usage analytics are collected. Your code stays on your machine.</p>

        <h2>9. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Software, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of a third party.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Licensor may also terminate this Agreement for any reason upon notice. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession. Sections 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 14 shall survive termination.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of North Carolina, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

            <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> The failure of Licensor to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
